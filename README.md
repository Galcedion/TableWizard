# TableWizard
Firefox AddOn for live manipulation of HTML tables
## Core functionality
- highlight matching table cells
- delete rows (either single row or multiple depending on matches in the target cell)
- delete columns (either single column or multiple depending on matches in the target cell)
- export table to new tab or print the table itself
- each table is managed separately
- all changes are temporary and can be reverted without page reload
## Available settings
- Choose the cell-highlight color (Hex based, needs at least 3 digits but has full RGBA-support)
